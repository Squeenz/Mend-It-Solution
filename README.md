# Mend-It-Solution
C++ hardware store application which uses programming desing patterns with oop. The app allows you to order items from different branches, 
the data from each branch is stored in seperated json files. The branch json files are only read on the first launch so if you add items while the
app is excecuted then it won't know about them.

# Desing Patterns Used
- Factory
- Observer
- Product
